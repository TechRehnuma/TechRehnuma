  <b>👋 Hello, I'm Usama</b> — a Tech-YouTuber, creative at heart, and the founder of 'Tech Rehnuma'. Currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science, I dive deep into programming languages such as Java, C, C++, Assembly, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I've studied databases including MySQL and SQL.
</p>

<p>
  🎨 Beyond academia, I'm a freelance graphic designer and video editor proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Adobe Premiere Pro. Through my YouTube channel, I simplify complex tech topics into digestible content for everyone. With 7 years of hands-on experience, I bridge the gap between technical prowess and creative finesse, leveraging tools like DALL·E and ChatGPT to bring innovative concepts to life.
